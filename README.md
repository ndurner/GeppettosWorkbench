# Geppetto's Workbench
OpenAI Playground Extension

## Description
This extends the OpenAI Playground in several ways:
1. defaults to GPT-4
1. sets parameters to encourage factual results (and curb hallucination & confabulation)
1. declutters the UI

# Features
* not affected by the ChatGPT geo-block for Italy, so can be used as a (spartan) substitude
